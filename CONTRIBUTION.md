## Before you contribute
Before you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with us first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can plan things out and help each other out and possibly guide each other. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid frustration later on.

## Code reviews
All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose.
